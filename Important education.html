                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Before you jump into the preparation for the course, you have to understand your eligibility. Here are some criteria that you must look for if you wish to become a great programmer:
                    You need to select either the science or commerce field in 10+2 if you want to become a programmer in India.
                    A minimum of 60 percent is desired for admission in good colleges across India and even in some organizations hiring programmers.
                    You need to become familiar with a programming language like JAVA, Python, R, or any language you are keen on. 
                    You should get an internship in the programming field.
                    This will help you to get a job.
                    There is no minimum age, but most colleges require you to be at least 17 years before giving you admission.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Diploma Courses </p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Diploma courses are the next choice open to you.
                They aren’t very well known. They don’t have any age limit and can also be used for a career shift.
                You just have to enrol by paying the required fees and start learning.
                Additional Skills expected from a Programmer
                Once you have achieved all the exceptional educational qualifications that you require to become a programmer,
                 there are other skills that you need to have.
                You need to understand the basics of software engineering.
                You also need to have logical thinking skills, be a team member and also have great problem solving skills. 
                Programming is analytical work, so make sure you have patience and are ready to go over a single error multiple times to fix it.
                It can be quite demanding with mentally and physically.
                But, if all of these seem interesting to you, then you are on the right track to become a program. Best of luck, and code your way to the top.
